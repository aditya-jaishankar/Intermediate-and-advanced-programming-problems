# Intermediate-and-advanced-programming-problems

This repository contains my solutions to the intermeditate and advanced programming problems, as classifed here: https://adriann.github.io/programming_problems.html

#### Problem 1

Write a program that outputs all possibilities to put + or - or nothing between the numbers 1,2,â€¦,9 (in this order) such that the result is 100. For example 1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6 + 78 + 9 = 100.

##### Solution

```python
def function(args):
  return out
```
